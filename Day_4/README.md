Data Used

To illustrate how ensembles work, here, I used the dataset on U.S. political contributions. The original data set was prepared by Ben Wieder at FiveThirtyEight, who dug around the U.S. government's political contribution registry and found that when scientists donate to politician, it's usually to Democrats. The data is based on the observation on the share of donations being made to Republicans and Democrats.
Here, I have to predict the most likely the donation made by the republican or democratic party. (binary classification)

The evaluation metrics used is ROC_AUC_SCORE.
